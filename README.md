# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
Analysis of Pewlett-Hackard employee data

# Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to advise Pewlett-Hackard on employee retirements so they can prepare for the so-called “silver tsunami” and assist Pewlett-Hackard with switching database management to SQL.

# Results:
- Around 90400 Pewlett-Hackard employees are retirement ready.
- Only 1550 current current retirement-ready employees are mentorship eligible.
- There are 2 retirement-ready managers but no mentorship eligible managers to mentor the replacements for that role.
- The majority of retirement-ready employees are Senior Engineers, but amongst the mentor eligible employees Senior Engineers are in the minority. 

# Summary
### How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
As the "silver tsunami" begins, as many as 90,400 roles will need replacements based on unique_titles.csv. A query should  be made to determine how many mentorship eligible employees are available per department alongside the number of employees leaving per department so Pewlett-Hackard can determine if there are enough mentors per department.
### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
Based on mentorship_eligibility.csv, only 1550 current retirement-ready employees are qualified to mentor new employees. Even if mentors take on multiple mentees at a time, there may not be enough to mentor all new employees. It may be beneficial to query the data for current employees that may not quite be retirement-ready but are nearing their retirement age to provide more mentors for incoming employees.
